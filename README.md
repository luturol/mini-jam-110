This is a project made for the MiniJam 110, and the theme is Sacrifice and the limitation is Failure is Inevitable.

We decide to make a game where you are a Game Producer, and you needo to manage your team to create your own game, but remember to prioritize what really matters and sacrifice superfluous things.
